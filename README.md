#EDU-RESQ: Automating Education & Healthcare Management
EDU-RESQ is an RFID-based system that eliminates manual inefficiencies in resource allocation and secure data storage.

How It Works:
Instant Scanning: Users scan RFID-enabled ID cards to retrieve profile data from a web-based database.
Automated Allocation: The system instantly assigns hospital beds or exam seats.
Multi-Channel Notifications: Assignments are displayed on local LCD screens and sent directly to users via SMS and email.

Core Benefits:
For Healthcare: Accelerates patient admissions, securely stores digital health records, and enables seamless, fraud-proof insurance claim verification to prevent medi-claim rejections.
For Education: Ensures organized, error-free, and malpractice-proof exam seating.

Future Roadmap:
EDU-RESQ is evolving to include facial recognition, blockchain-based security, and an AI-powered mobile app to further revolutionize smart automation and real-time tracking across industries.
