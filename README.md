# EDU-RESQ
EDU-RESQ is an RFID-based resource allocation system designed to automate exam seat assignments and hospital bed management while ensuring secure digital health record storage. By integrating RFID technology with a web-based database, it eliminates manual inefficiencies, improves real-time tracking, and enables seamless insurance claim verification to prevent medi-claim rejections. This innovation won first prize at IETE Students' Innovation Day for its practical impact.

The system works by scanning RFID-enabled ID cards, retrieving user data, and automatically assigning seats or hospital beds. Allocations are displayed on LCD screens and sent via SMS/email, ensuring efficient and error-free management. Hospitals benefit from faster patient admissions and fraud-proof insurance processing, while educational institutions gain organized, malpractice-free exam seating.

Future enhancements include facial recognition, blockchain-based security, and an AI-powered mobile app for real-time tracking. By streamlining resource allocation in education and healthcare, EDU-RESQ has the potential to transform smart automation across various industries.
